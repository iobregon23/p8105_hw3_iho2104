## Problem 1

Write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure
of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illustrative
examples of observations.

Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the results of each):

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

There are 134 aisles and most items are fresh fruits and vegetables.

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

![](p8105_hw3_iho2104_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

First, do some data cleaning:

- format the data to use appropriate variable names;

- focus on the “Overall Health” topic

- include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”

- organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to
  “Excellent”

``` r
brfss_df =  
  brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(str_detect("Overall Health", topic)) |> 
  arrange(factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Very Good", "Good", "Excellent")))
```

- In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? 36
  locations consisting of: AZ, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN

``` r
brfss_df |> 
  filter(year == 2002) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  summarize(observations =n()) |> 
  filter(observations >= 7) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 36 × 2
    ##    locationabbr observations
    ##    <chr>               <int>
    ##  1 AZ                     10
    ##  2 CO                     20
    ##  3 CT                     35
    ##  4 DE                     15
    ##  5 FL                     35
    ##  6 GA                     15
    ##  7 HI                     20
    ##  8 ID                     10
    ##  9 IL                     15
    ## 10 IN                     10
    ## # ℹ 26 more rows

What about in 2010? 45 locations consisting of: AL, AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT,
DE, FL, GA, HI

``` r
brfss_2002 = brfss_df |> 
  filter(year == 2010) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr) |> 
  summarize(observations =n()) |> 
  filter(observations >= 7) 
```

- Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
  contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
  across locations within a state.

- Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state
  (that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the
  geom_line geometry and group aesthetic will help).

``` r
brfss_excellent = 
  brfss_df |> 
  filter(str_detect("Excellent", response)) |> 
  group_by(locationabbr, year) |> 
  summarize(avg_data_value = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE) ) |> 
  select(year, locationabbr, avg_data_value ) 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'locationabbr'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

- Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
  distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
  locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_ny = brfss_df |> 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY", year %in% c(2006, 2010)) |> 
  ggplot( aes(x = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")),  
             y = data_value)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 2) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of data_value by Response in NY State Counties",
       x = "Response",
       y = "Data Value") +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = T )
```

## Problem 3

Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets. Your final
dataset should include all originally observed variables; exclude
participants less than 21 years of age, and those with missing
demographic data; and encode data with reasonable variable classes
(i.e. not numeric, and using factors with the ordering of tables and
plots in mind).

Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category, and create a visualization of the age distributions
for men and women in each education category. Comment on these items.

Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total
activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities
(y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men to women and
have separate panels for each education level. Include a trend line or a
smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for
each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe in words
any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph; including
smooth trends may help identify differences.
